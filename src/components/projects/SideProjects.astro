        <a href="https://github.com/rnjohn/logisim-cannon" class="underline font-bold">Logisim Cannon Game</a><br/>
        This is a game I made using <a href="https://cburch.com/logisim/" class="underline">Logisim</a>, where the goal is to destroy all the stars in the top of the 32x32 screen using the keyboard to control the cannon at the bottom. <br/>
        The bullets bounce in all the screen boundaries and can hit the cannon, ending the game if it happens.<br/>
        Each row has its own memory and can calculate and displace the bullet according on previous position, direction and next position.<br/>
        This is actually one of the projects I liked doing the most since I was able to manipulate logic circuits and using them to manipulate data.<br/>

        img-resizer (WIP)<br/>
        This is a project which consists of a image resizer, using queues for processing user uploads, AWS for cloud storage of said images, and a public API so other apps can consume the service.

    <p>For the Microsoft Global Hackathon 2023 I delved into how games were written for the Nintendo Entertainment System (from 1983) using Assembly for the MOS 6502 and made a <a href="https://slides.com/rnjohn/nes-development" class="underline">presentation</a> for a meetup we had on Bogotá, Colombia 🇨🇴</p>

      For the Microsoft Global Hackathon 2022 I contributed to the <a href="https://github.com/PlayFab/thundernetes" class="underline">Thundernetes</a> project, which is an open-source project to run game servers on a Kubernetes cluster.<br/>
      I modified a Docker image and documented instructions to easily set up a <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us" class="underline">Minecraft</a> server using Thundernetes.
